Spring Data Repository
--------------------------

. Provide a Implementation of the repository pattern
. Concept is originally from Erics'book Domain Driven Design 

. A Repository has methods for retrieving domain objects should delegate to a specialized Repository
  object such that alternative storage implementations may be interchanged.
. This is important. It allows you to easily substitute the persistence layer 
. i.e going from SQL to NoSQL

Spring Data JPA
----------------------
. Spring Data JPA is part of a layer family of Spring Data Projects.
. Uses Hibernate for persistence to supported RDBS systems.
 . Just about any major relational database.
. You extend a Java Repository Interface
. Spring Data JPA provides the implementation at run time.
. No SQL required.


MVC
---------------------------
Spring Controller

. Annotate Controller Class with @Controller
 . This will register the class as a spring Bean and as a Controller in Spring MVC
 
. To map methods to http request paths use @RequestMapping


Opinionated Design
---------------------------------------
. Opinionated-- There is one way of doing things.
. Un-Opinionated - You are open to doing things anyway you like.
. Spring Boot - Bring a number of 'Opinionated' default 
  configuration
  . Thus using spring boot is following an opinionated design
