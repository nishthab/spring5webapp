Spring Data Repository
--------------------------

. Provide a Implementation of the repository pattern
. Concept is originally from Erics'book Domain Driven Design 

. A Repository has methods for retrieving domain objects should delegate to a specialized Repository
  object such that alternative storage implementations may be interchanged.
. This is important. It allows you to easily substitute the persistence layer 
. i.e going from SQL to NoSQL

Spring Data JPA
----------------------
. Spring Data JPA is part of a layer family of Spring Data Projects.
. Uses Hibernate for persistence to supported RDBS systems.
 . Just about any major relational database.
. You extend a Java Repository Interface
. Spring Data JPA provides the implementation at run time.
. No SQL required.
